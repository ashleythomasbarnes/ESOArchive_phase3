# ESOArchive_phase3

## Overview
This repository serves as a **working area for Phase 3–related projects** and **preparation of data for Phase 3 uploads** to the ESO Science Archive.  
It contains scripts, notebooks, and documentation supporting validation, metadata generation, and ingestion of various Phase 3 datasets.

## Structure
- `phase3_*` — project-specific folders (e.g. APEX, SPHERE, NGC 253, KiDS) containing Phase 3 preparation scripts and metadata examples.  
- `general/` — shared tools and templates used across different Phase 3 releases.  
- `chatGPT_docs/` — experimental notes, drafts, or helper scripts generated via ChatGPT.  

## Purpose
This repository is a **workspace**, not a finalized software package. It is used for:
- Testing and organizing scripts related to ESO Phase 3 data releases.  
- Preparing FITS headers, catalogue metadata, and validation checks.  
- Keeping supporting documentation and templates in one place.

## Notes
- This repository is under active development and may contain incomplete or experimental content.  
- For official documentation on Phase 3 standards, refer to [ESO Phase 3 Data Release Guidelines](https://www.eso.org/sci/observing/phase3.html).
